This error typically occurs when using Expo's managed workflow and attempting to import a module that's not properly configured or isn't compatible with the Expo environment.  A common scenario is importing modules that rely on native code or require specific build configurations that aren't handled by Expo's managed workflow out-of-the-box.  The error message itself can be vague, often just showing a generic 'Cannot find module' error, making diagnosis challenging.  The underlying issue might be a missing dependency, an incorrect import path, an incompatibility with Expo's SDK version, or a problem with the module's package.json setup.
